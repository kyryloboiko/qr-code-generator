# ðŸŽ¨ Custom QR Code Generator

This Python script provides an interactive command-line interface to generate high-quality, customized QR codes. It allows you to embed a logo, customize the colors of the modules and position markers ("eyes"), and generate high-resolution images (e.g., 2K) with rounded modules for a modern look.

## Features

  * **Interactive CLI:** No command-line arguments needed. Just run the script and answer the prompts.
  * **Logo Embedding:** Automatically centers your logo with a clean, rounded white background to ensure scannability.
  * **Full Color Customization:** Set custom colors for both the QR code modules (dots) and the position markers ("eyes").
  * **Flexible Color Input:** Accepts plain color names (e.g., `red`, `blue`) and HEX codes (e.g., `#FF0000`, `#0044CC`).
  * **High-Resolution Output:** Generates high-quality images, defaulting to 2048x2048 (2K). The size is dynamically calculated to avoid blurring.
  * **Stylish Design:** Creates QR codes with rounded modules and matching rounded "eyes".

## Example Output

(Here you would add an image generated by your script, e.g., `my_custom_qr.png`)

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3 and two external libraries: `qrcode` and `Pillow`.

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install qrcode pillow
```

-----

## How to Use

1.  Save the script as `create_qr.py`.

2.  Place a logo file (e.g., `logo.png`) in the same directory (or have the path to it ready).

3.  Run the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python create_qr.py
    ```

4.  Follow the interactive prompts to customize your QR code. Press **Enter** to accept the default value shown in `[]`.

### Example Session

Here is what the script looks like when you run it:

```
